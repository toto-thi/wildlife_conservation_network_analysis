# wildlife_conservation_network_analysis

This project was my mini-project 3 of the data science course at Ã…bo Akademi.

The project is anticipated to yield insights into the structure of the Reddit wildlife conservation network, including identifying influential users and communities. We aim to quantify sentiment trends and highlight influential topics. Ultimately, this analysis will contribute valuable information for strategizing and enhancing wildlife conservation efforts in the digital realm.
